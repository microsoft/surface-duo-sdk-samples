This repo contains the samples for Surface Duo for native Android. For Xamarin samples go here: [https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-sdk-xamarin-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-sdk-xamarin-samples)


## Getting Started
To learn how to load your app on to emulator, and to use it ,see the full documentation here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen)



## Build and Test
To use the DualView and ExtendCanvas samples, you will first need to create an Google Map API key. Follow the instructions outlined [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to create an API key.

After you have an API key, put it in the following files:

* DualView/src/main/assets/googlemap.html
* ExtendCanvas/src/main/assets/googlemapsearch.html

By replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` string with your actual key
